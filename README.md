## ðŸ§  Project Overview:

JungleGym is an open-source playground for testing and developing autonomous web agents. Here, you can download demonstration data, test your agents with ground-truth trajectories (using the JungleGym APIs), and test your web agents. These Datasets are all available in the JungleGym API and in the [JungleGym](https://junglegym.ai) playground, including 6 fully functional emulated websites (from WebArena) to test your Agents.

### âœ… JungleGym Main Features:

We're hosting 3 web agent datasets: Mind2Web, WebArena and AgentInstruct.

1. Mind2Web: Ground truth for ~2k tasks across 137 websites, including full HTML page states and screenshots. Good for broad testing and development across a range of sites and tasks.

2. WebArena: A task dataset and 6 realistic, fully functional, sandboxed websites. Good for deep testing of many tasks and paths on a single site.

3. AgentInstruct: ~1.8k agent trajectories designed for fine-tuning language models (i.e. llama2) on agent tasks. It was introduced with [AgentTuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12823).

4. TreeVoyager: An LLM-based (GPT-4 Turbo) DOM parser designed to implement some principles from the papers ['Tree of Thoughts'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) (ToT) and ['Minecraft's Voyager'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291) to parse, generate curriculum, select HTML IDs, generate paths, and create skills (memory) for the steps required in the agent trajectory. Note: this is still in very early development, and we would be keen to hear your feedback or contributions.

5. APIs for all Web Agent Datasets & TreeVoyager: JungleGym provides APIs for these three datasets and TreeVoyager. You can use these APIs to test ground-truths with your agent trajectories and you can use TreeVoyager for parsing the DOM with the suggested code (with Python's Selenium).

For the full documentation, you can read the [JungleGym Docs here](https://docs.junglegym.ai/junglegym/junglegym-ai-overview).

This Github repo structure is broken down into two main components: 
1. JungleGym (the JungleGym folder) is a Streamlit app to visualize the web agent datasets, trajectories, steps, and web snapshots and to download the agent datasets.
2. TreeVoyager (the TreeVoyager folder) - The LLM-based DOM parser described above in step 4.

#### ðŸŒ² TreeVoyager in-depth:

- **Purpose**: TreeVoyager is a LLM-based (GPT-4 Turbo) DOM parser as described above. The goal of the TreeVoyager's Streamlit page is to show how it works (step-by-step) and to visualize its outputs and suggested code for every step.
- The source code of TreeVoyager is in this repo under the TreeVoyager folder.
- For instruction and documentation on how to use the TreeVoyager API, refer to the [docs](https://docs.junglegym.ai/junglegym/api-documentation/treevoyager-api).

## ðŸ”® Future Work & Contributions:

- TreeVoyager is a very early release. We expect this to be an ongoing project that adds new features and improvements. 
- We think Vision will be a key component for web agents. Once Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more powerful and accessible, we think they will heavily contribute to the web agents field, whether it is a combination of HTML/DOM interaction with assisted vision or purely vision-based.
- This is a very early version of JungleGym and TreeVoyager. We would be keen to hear from you and from your contributions!
