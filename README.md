## ðŸ§  Project Overview:

JungleGym is an open-source playground for testing and developing autonomous web agents. To be clear, this is not an Agent, but rather a tool to test and build agents with datasets. Here, you can download demonstration data and test your agents with ground-truth trajectories and correct results (using the JungleGym APIs). These Datasets are all available in the JungleGym API and in the [JungleGym](https://junglegym.ai) playground, including 6 realistic, fully functional, sandboxed websites (from WebArena) to test your Agents.

Who is this for? Primarily for agent builders.

### âœ… Instructions and sample code:

We're hosting 3 web agent datasets (available in the API and in the [JungleGym](https://junglegym.ai)): Mind2Web, WebArena, and AgentInstruct to test your Agents with.

1. Mind2Web: Ground truth for ~2k tasks across 137 websites, including full HTML page states and screenshots. Good for broad testing and development across a range of sites and tasks.
   Here is how you can use the Mind2Web Dataset API to test your Agent with the ground truth. You can find the website, task, and annotation ID in [JungleGym](https://junglegym.ai/Mind2Web) or in the API.

   Mind2Web [API endpoints docs](https://docs.junglegym.ai/junglegym/api-documentation/mind2web-api)
   
   Here is an example to get the ground truth actions of one task to compare your agent with. ([One click run in Replit](https://replit.com/@mmascorro1/Example-of-how-to-use-the-Mind2Web-Dataset?v=1)):
   ```python
   import requests
   import json
   
   """
   Find the desired task and annotation ID from the Mind2Web dataset page in junglegym.ai/Mind2Web (or from the API)
   Example Task details:
   Website = 'https://www.kohls.com'
   Task = "Add the cheapest Women's Sweaters to my shopping cart."
   Annotation ID ='4bc70fa1-e817-405f-b113-0919e8e94205'
   """
   task_annotation_id = '4bc70fa1-e817-405f-b113-0919e8e94205'
   
   # Mind2Web API's endpoint to get ground truth for the list of actions given a task/annotation ID:
   url = f"http://api.junglegym.ai/get_list_of_actions?annotation_id={task_annotation_id}"
   response = requests.get(url)
   data = response.json()
   
   print("Number of total steps to accomplish this task:", len(data['action_reprs']))
   
   print ("Ground truth action for first step in te list:", data['action_reprs'][0])#-> This is the list of ground truth actions you should compare your agent with.
   
   print ("HTML Element data for this first step:", data['actions'][0]['pos_candidates'])#-> These are the extended DOM elements of the first action.
   ```

3. WebArena: A task dataset and 6 realistic, fully functional, sandboxed websites. Good for deep testing of many tasks and paths on a single site.
   You can find a desired website, task, and task_id in [JungleGym](https://junglegym.ai/WebArena) or in the API.
   
   WebArena [API endpoints docs](https://docs.junglegym.ai/junglegym/api-documentation/webarena-api).
   
   Here is an example of how to get a WebArena task and the final ground truth response. Unlike Mind2Web which shows every step in the DOM, WebArena only shows the final ground truth response. ([One click run in Replit](https://replit.com/@mmascorro1/WebArena-API-Task-Example?v=1)):
   ```python
   import requests
   import json
   """
   Get the desired task from the WebArena dataset page in junglegym.ai/WebArena (or from the API)
   Desired task details:
   Website = 'http://shop.junglegym.ai' (WebArena's sandboxed emulated shopping website)
   Task = "What is the price range for products from ugreen?"
   """
   
   WebArena_task = 'What is the price range for products from ugreen?'
   # WebArena API's endpoint to get ground truth result given a task:
   url = f"http://api.junglegym.ai/get_webarena_by_task?task={WebArena_task}"
   # Send the GET request
   response = requests.get(url)
   data = response.json()
      
   print(
       data['data'][0]['eval']['reference_answers']['must_include']
   )  # -> This will give the final ground truth result for the task to compare with your Web agent's response. In this case, the correct ground truth response should be: ['6.99', '38.99']
   ```
   

5. AgentInstruct: ~1.8k agent trajectories designed for fine-tuning language models (i.e. llama2) on agent tasks. Unlike Mind2Web and WebArena, this dataset is in the form of a conversational/chat LLM (from: 'gpt'/'human'). It was introduced with [AgentTuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12823). Ideally used for fine-tuning your LLM (most LLMs haven't been trained with Agent datasets/trajectories). ([One click run in Replit](https://replit.com/@mmascorro1/AgentInstruct-Dataset-fetch-example?v=1)
   ```python
   import requests
   import json
   """
   Get the full AgentInstruct dataset with ~1.8K trajectories/conversations:
   """
   #List of "ids" (categories in the dataset):
   """
   "os" (Operating System)
   "webshop"
   "mind2web"
   "kg" (Knowledge Graph)
   "db" (Database)
   "alfworld"
   """
   #AgentInstruct API's endpoint to get ground truth result given a task:
   url = f"http://api.junglegym.ai/load_agent_instruct"
   response = requests.get(url)  #this gets the full ~1.8K dataset
   data = response.json()
   
   print("Number of total conversations:", len(data['data']))
   
   print(data['data'][1000]['conversations'])  #This will get the 1000th conversation
   
   print(
       data['data'][1000]['id']
   )  #The id (category) of the 1000th conversation. In this case "alfworld_267" (ALFWorld, index=267)
   ```

7. TreeVoyager: An LLM-based DOM parser (using GPT-4 Turbo) designed to implement some principles from the papers ['Tree of Thoughts'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) (ToT) and ['Minecraft's Voyager'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291) to parse the right HTML element, generate curriculum (plan), and generate suggested code for every step in the agent trajectory. Note: this is not an Agent, it's only an LLM parser in very early development. We would be keen to hear your feedback or contributions.

## Additional Resources (optional read):

#### ðŸŒ² TreeVoyager in-depth:

- **Purpose**: TreeVoyager is an LLM-based DOM parser (using GPT-4 Turbo) as described above. The goal of the TreeVoyager's Streamlit page is to show how it works (step-by-step) and to visualize its outputs and suggested code for every step. You can also use it with the API.
- The source code of TreeVoyager is in this repo under the TreeVoyager folder.
- For instruction and documentation on how to use the TreeVoyager API, refer to the [docs](https://docs.junglegym.ai/junglegym/api-documentation/treevoyager-api).

## ðŸ”® Future Work & Contributions:

- JungleGym is a very early release. We expect this to be an ongoing project that adds new features and improvements. 
- We think Vision will be a key component for web agents in the future. Once Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more powerful and accessible, we think they will heavily contribute to the web agents field, whether it is a combination of HTML/DOM interaction with assisted vision or purely vision-based.
- We would be keen to hear from you and from your contributions! This is just a small project to help the Agents ecosystem.
